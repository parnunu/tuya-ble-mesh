A fully local Home Assistant integration for controlling Tuya BLE Mesh devices. No cloud. No Tuya account required for daily use.

This fork adds HACS-packaged direct control for already-provisioned SIG Mesh
Generic On/Off and Generic Level lights using a dedicated local BlueZ adapter.

## What is this?

Many affordable smart lighting products (sold under brands like AwoX, Malmbergs, and others) use **Tuya BLE Mesh** firmware internally. They're typically controlled via the Tuya Smart app through Tuya's cloud servers.

This integration replaces cloud control with **direct BLE communication**, keeping everything local on your network. Your smart lights respond faster, work without internet, and don't depend on any external servers.

### How it works

There are two connection modes:

**Mode 1: Bridge daemon (RPi)**
```
Home Assistant  ←HTTP→  Bridge Daemon (RPi)  ←BLE Mesh→  Devices
```
1. A Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth runs the bridge daemon near your BLE mesh devices
2. The HA integration communicates with the bridge over your local network
3. The bridge translates commands to/from the BLE mesh protocol

**Mode 2: ESPHome BLE Proxy**
```
Home Assistant  ←API→  ESPHome BLE Proxy  ←BLE Mesh→  Devices
```
For SIG Mesh devices, any ESPHome device with BLE proxy enabled can be used instead of a dedicated RPi. This is simpler to set up and doesn't require a separate bridge daemon.

**Mode 3: Direct local BlueZ adapter (existing SIG Mesh lights)**
```
Home Assistant custom integration  ←BlueZ/hci0→  SIG Mesh Light
```
Already-provisioned Generic On/Off and Generic Level lights can be imported with their NetKey,
DevKey, AppKey, unicast addresses, and IV index. The selected adapter is owned
directly by this integration; do not let another process own the same adapter.

Bridge and proxy modes do not require Bluetooth hardware on Home Assistant.
Direct mode requires a dedicated local BlueZ adapter.

## Tested Devices

| Device | Brand | Type | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| LED Driver 9952126 | Malmbergs | Dimmable LED driver | ✅ Tested — on/off, brightness |
| Smart Plug S17 | Malmbergs | BLE Mesh relay plug | ✅ Tested — on/off, SIG Mesh provisioned |
| Generic SIG Mesh light | Tuya-compatible | SIG Mesh Generic On/Off + Level light | ✅ On/off tested; brightness implemented for model `0x1002` |

### Potentially Compatible

Devices using the Tuya BLE Mesh / Telink stack with service UUID `fe07`:

| Brand | Example Products | Vendor ID | Status |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| **AwoX** | Mesh lights | `0x0160` | Protocol compatible, untested |
| **Malmbergs** | LED drivers, plugs | `0x1001` | Hardware tested |
| **Dimond/retsimx** | Mesh lights | `0x0211` | Protocol compatible, untested |

## Features

### Device Control
- **Power on/off** — instant local control, no cloud round-trip
- **Brightness** — 1–100% dimming with smooth transitions
- **Color temperature** — warm to cool white (CCT)
- **RGB color** — full color control on supported devices
- **Switch** — relay control for smart plugs

### Connectivity
- **Auto-discovery** — finds `out_of_mesh*` and `tymesh*` devices via BLE
- **HA Bluetooth integration** — uses Home Assistant's native Bluetooth API (no adapter conflicts)
- **Dedicated local adapter mode** — direct BlueZ ownership for imported SIG Mesh lights
- **ESPHome BLE proxy** — use any ESPHome device as a BLE bridge (SIG Mesh)
- **Auto-reconnect** — exponential backoff (5s → 5min) on connection loss
- **Keep-alive** — maintains BLE connections proactively to minimize latency
- **Command queue** — delivery with TTL and retry under rapid HA automations
- **Reconnect debounce** — prevents reconnect storms after transient failures

### Status & Monitoring
- **Push-based updates** — BLE notifications drive state changes; automatic fallback to poll mode
- **RSSI sensor** — signal strength from HA Bluetooth API, adaptive polling
- **Firmware version** — sensor for device firmware tracking
- **Staleness detection** — coordinator marks unavailable if no updates for configurable period
- **Connection statistics** — visible in HA diagnostics
- **Device triggers** — automation triggers for connection events
- **Logbook integration** — state changes logged in HA logbook

### Protocol Support
- **Tuya proprietary BLE Mesh** (Telink TLK8232 / TLK8258) — all light and plug features
- **SIG Mesh (Bluetooth Mesh)** — provisioning, proxy, segmentation/reassembly (experimental)
- **Dual-stack** — both protocols work simultaneously on the same HA instance

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add URL: `https://github.com/parnunu/tuya-ble-mesh`
4. Category: **Integration**
5. Search for **"Tuya BLE Mesh"** and click **Download**
6. **Restart Home Assistant**

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/tuya_ble_mesh/` to your HA `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Adding a device

**Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → search **"Tuya BLE Mesh"**

The integration will scan for nearby BLE Mesh devices automatically. Select your device from the list, or enter the MAC address manually.

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Device type | Light or Plug | Light |
| MAC Address | BLE MAC (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) | *required* |
| Bridge Host | IP/hostname of the bridge RPi | *required* |
| Bridge Port | Bridge daemon HTTP port | `8099` |
| Mesh Name | Mesh network name | `out_of_mesh` |
| Mesh Password | Mesh network password | `123456` |
| Vendor ID | Vendor identifier (hex) | `0x1001` |

For an already-provisioned SIG Mesh lamp, select **Existing SIG Mesh Light
(On/Off + Brightness)** and enter its 32-hex-character NetKey, DevKey, AppKey, device and
controller unicast addresses, IV index, and dedicated BlueZ adapter (normally
`hci0`). These credentials remain in Home Assistant's local config-entry
storage, which is not encrypted. Protect the HA config directory and backups.
The credentials are not sent to a cloud service.

Advanced import/migration tooling can also provide an `initial_sequence` value
and `bind_models: true`. This resumes above prior commissioning traffic and
binds AppKey index `0` to Generic OnOff Server `0x1000` and Generic Level Server
`0x1002`, avoiding Mesh replay-protection failures after migration.

### Bridge Daemon

The bridge daemon runs on a Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth, close to your mesh devices:

```bash
# On the RPi
cd ~/tuya-ble-mesh
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/ble_mesh_daemon.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8099
```

The daemon exposes a simple HTTP API that the HA integration uses to send commands and receive status.

### Vendor IDs

Different brands embed different vendor IDs in the Telink mesh protocol:

| Brand | Vendor ID |
|-------|-----------|
| Tuya (default) | `0x1001` |
| AwoX | `0x0160` |
| Malmbergs | `0x1001` |
| Dimond/retsimx | `0x0211` |

If commands don't work with the default, try `0x0160` (AwoX) or `0x0211` (Dimond).

## Entities

Each device creates:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `light.<name>` | Light | Power, brightness, color temperature |
| `switch.<name>` | Switch | Power on/off (plugs only) |
| `sensor.<name>_signal` | Sensor | BLE signal strength (RSSI) |
| `sensor.<name>_firmware` | Sensor | Device firmware version |

## Hardware Setup

### What you need

- **Home Assistant** 2024.1 or later (any installation method)
- **Raspberry Pi** (3B+ or 4) with built-in Bluetooth — runs the bridge daemon
- **Tuya BLE Mesh devices** — compatible devices (see Tested Devices section)

### Bluetooth Setup

This integration uses **Home Assistant's native Bluetooth integration** (since v0.33). You no longer need a second USB adapter or ESPHome proxy to avoid conflicts.

**Recommended:** Enable Home Assistant's built-in Bluetooth integration and let it manage the adapter. The bridge daemon on the RPi handles direct BLE communication.

> **Note:** If you have an older setup with a second USB Bluetooth adapter or ESPHome proxy, these continue to work — the integration supports both modes.

## Development

```bash
# Clone and set up virtual environment
git clone https://github.com/11z4t/tuya-ble-mesh.git
cd tuya-ble-mesh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run full check pipeline (must pass before committing)
bash scripts/run-checks.sh

# Scan for nearby BLE mesh devices
python scripts/scan.py

# Run tests only
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q
```

### Check pipeline

CI runs: **ruff** (lint + format), **mypy** (strict), **pytest** (1922 tests), **HACS validation**.
Local-only: **bandit**, **safety**, **detect-secrets**.

All checks must pass before committing — enforced by `run-checks.sh`.

## Verification Status

| Area | CI Verified | Hardware Tested | Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Telink mesh protocol | ✅ Unit tests | 1 device (LED Driver 9952126) | on/off, brightness confirmed |
| SIG Mesh provisioning | ✅ Unit tests | 1 device (Smart Plug S17) | on/off confirmed |
| SIG Mesh segmentation | ✅ Unit tests | Limited | SAR fragmentation tested in CI |
| HA integration layer | ✅ 1922 tests | 2 devices | Config flow, coordinator, entities |
| HA Bluetooth API | ✅ Unit tests | Indirect | HaBleakClientWrapper integration |
| BLE reconnection | ✅ Unit tests | Observed | Exponential backoff with debounce |

**Overall status: HACS beta-ready / stable for limited use.** Tested with 2 Malmbergs devices. SIG Mesh layer has known simplifications. Not broadly validated across vendors.

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found

**Symptom:** "Device not found" during setup

**Possible causes:**
- Device not powered on or too far away (>5m from adapter)
- Device already paired to Tuya Smart app (close the app completely)
- Device needs factory reset (power cycle 3-5 times quickly)

**Solution:** Ensure device is in pairing mode, close Tuya Smart app, move device closer to adapter.

### Connection Timeouts

**Symptom:** Connection times out during provisioning

**Possible causes:**
- Weak BLE signal
- Device in wrong state

**Solution:** Move device closer, try factory reset.

### Device Shows Unavailable After HA Restart

**Symptom:** Entity shows unavailable after HA restart

**Cause:** Bridge daemon not running, or device temporarily out of range.

**Solution:** Ensure bridge daemon is running (`python scripts/ble_mesh_daemon.py`). The integration will auto-reconnect with exponential backoff once the bridge is reachable.

## Known Limitations

- **Bridge required** — HA cannot talk BLE mesh directly; the RPi bridge daemon must be running (for Telink devices)
- **Limited device testing** — only 2 Malmbergs devices tested; other brands are protocol-compatible but untested
- **Factory reset** — some devices need 5x rapid power cycling to enter provisioning mode
- **No OTA** — firmware updates are out of scope
- **SIG Mesh Proxy SAR** — only COMPLETE PDUs supported; FIRST/CONTINUE/LAST fragmentation not implemented
- **SIG Mesh pending responses** — keyed by opcode only; concurrent requests for the same opcode may collide
