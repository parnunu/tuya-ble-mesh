## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.40.6] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- Use the SIG Light Lightness Server (`0x1300`) for brightness when Composition
  Data does not advertise Generic Level Server (`0x1002`).
- Decode acknowledged Light Lightness Status messages into native Home
  Assistant brightness updates.

---

## [0.40.5] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Parse SIG Mesh Composition Data and bind Generic OnOff/Level models on the
  elements that actually host them instead of assuming one primary element.
- Persist the discovered Generic Level element and route brightness commands
  there while power commands continue to target the primary element.

---

## [0.40.4] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Adapt direct BlueZ one-argument notification callbacks to the integration's
  `(sender, data)` handler so Mesh status responses are processed.

---

## [0.40.3] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Supply Bleak 3's required BlueZ notification options when using the direct
  backend, preventing `KeyError('bluez')` after a successful connection.

---

## [0.40.2] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Make an explicitly selected BlueZ adapter use Bleak's native BlueZ scanner
  and client directly. This prevents Home Assistant's global Bluetooth router
  from redirecting a room-dedicated adapter to unrelated devices or proxies.

---

## [0.40.1] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Expose replay-safe initial sequence and Generic OnOff/Level model-binding
  controls in the existing SIG Mesh light config-flow form. This allows the
  normal Home Assistant UI/REST flow to complete an existing-device migration.

---

## [0.40.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- Native brightness control for imported SIG Mesh lights through Generic Level
  Set (`0x8206`) and Level Status (`0x8208`).
- Full signed Generic Level to Home Assistant brightness conversion (`0..255`).
- Level notification callbacks and coordinator state updates.
- Opt-in imported-light model binding for Generic OnOff (`0x1000`) and Generic
  Level (`0x1002`), with replay-safe sequence resumption.

### Changed
- Imported SIG Mesh lights now expose Home Assistant `brightness` color mode
  while retaining Generic OnOff power control.

### Fixed
- Reuse one Mesh transaction ID across BLE write retries while allocating a
  fresh network sequence number per transmission.
- Accept and use Home Assistant's BLE connection callback in `SIGMeshDevice`;
  direct-adapter imported lights now construct successfully at runtime.

---

## [0.39.2] — 2026-07-15

### Security documentation
- Clarify that SIG Mesh keys are stored locally in Home Assistant config-entry
  storage, which is filesystem-protected but not encrypted. HA configuration
  backups must be protected accordingly.

---

## [0.39.1] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Existing SIG Mesh Light (On/Off)** config-flow/import path for devices that
  are already provisioned and therefore advertise Proxy Service `0x1828`.
- **Direct BlueZ adapter ownership** option for installations using a dedicated
  local adapter rather than Home Assistant's Bluetooth scanner registry.
- Native on/off-only `light` entity backed by acknowledged Generic OnOff commands.

### Fixed
- Resolve duplicate `0x2ADD`/`0x2ADE` Proxy Data In/Out characteristic UUIDs by
  selecting the correct characteristic handles from the Proxy Service.

---

## [0.38.0] — 2026-03-31

### Removed
- **`async_start()` deprecated method** (`coordinator.py`) — was swallowing connection
  exceptions, hiding failures from HA Core. Use `async_initial_connect()` which propagates
  exceptions so HA shows "Retrying setup" and handles backoff correctly.

### Fixed
- **CI pipeline** (`scripts/run-checks.sh`) — corrected tool paths (`ruff`/`bandit` in
  `~/.local/bin`), `detect-secrets` skips gracefully if not installed, `pip-audit` now
  scans only production requirements from `manifest.json` (not the test venv)
- **Crypto safety assert** (`crypto.py`) — added `# nosec B101` for intentional CTR-block
  guard that must survive optimised builds

---

## [0.37.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Dynamic manufacturer name** (`__init__.py`, `const.py`) — `KNOWN_VENDOR_IDS` dict maps
  vendor IDs to brand names (Malmbergs, AwoX, Dimond, …); `DeviceInfo.manufacturer` now
  shows the actual brand instead of a hardcoded fallback
- **Phase-specific provisioning errors** (`config_flow.py`, all 8 translations) — three new
  error keys (`provisioning_appkey_failed`, `provisioning_proxy_failed`,
  `provisioning_pbgatt_failed`) with actionable guidance for each failure phase
- **Connection quality dBm thresholds** (all 8 translations) — state labels for
  `good`/`marginal`/`poor` now include the dBm range so users understand the scale
- **Light brightness mode attributes** (`light.py`) — `extra_state_attributes` property
  exposes `brightness_mode` (`rgb`/`white`) and `device_brightness` for dashboards and
  automations
- **Bridge validation progress feedback** (`config_flow.py`) — `status` description
  placeholder shown during SIG/Telink bridge connection test so the UI isn't silent
- **Diagnostics response-time documentation** (`diagnostics.py`) — `_info` key in
  `response_times` explains the p50/p95/p99 percentile semantics

### Changed
- **RSSI sensor** (`sensor.py`) — `value_fn` returns `None` for RSSI = 0 (BLE Mesh
  placeholder) so the entity shows as unavailable rather than a misleading zero

### Fixed
- **Last-seen UTC docstring** (`sensor.py`) — clarifies that `_last_seen_datetime` returns
  UTC and that HA auto-converts to local time for display

---

## [0.36.4] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **asyncio task GC** — four fire-and-forget tasks were silently dropped by the
  garbage collector before completing:
  - `transport/dispatcher.py`: `_send_with_retry` tasks (fixed in previous session)
  - `sig_mesh_provisioner_exchange.py`: `_process_notify` tasks created in `_on_notify()`
    callback — comment even said "prevent garbage collection" but the no-op lambda achieved
    nothing; replaced with `_notify_tasks: set` + add/discard pattern
  - `connection_manager.py`: reconnect-storm issue task and repair-issue task were local
    variables that went out of scope; added `_background_tasks: set` to `__init__` with
    proper lifecycle management
  - `coordinator.py`: `self.hass.async_create_task()` in `_on_vendor_update()` crashed
    with `AttributeError` in standalone/test mode (hass=None skips `super().__init__()`);
    replaced with `self._create_background_task()`
- **Rule S7 compliance** — `ValueError` in `power.py` replaced with `PowerControlError`;
  overly-broad `except Exception` in `sig_mesh_bridge.py` narrowed to specific types
- **Dead code removed** — `sig_mesh_bridge_telink.py`, `sig_mesh_bridge_http.py`,
  `logbook.py` dead branches, unused `type: ignore` comments
- **Translation** — `ble_adapter_busy` key added to issues namespace in all 9 language
  files; config flow type hints added for mypy --strict compliance
- **Coordinator refactor** — `_create_background_task()` helper extracted to unify
  HA-lifecycle-tracked vs standalone task creation across the coordinator

### Internal
- Full lib/ + HA integration code review completed (58 files)
- All 8 CI checks passing: ruff, mypy --strict, bandit, pip-audit, detect-secrets,
  pytest unit (1664 tests), pytest security (136 tests), pytest benchmark

---

## [0.36.3] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **SIG plug pairing: "does not expose Provisioning Service (0x1827)"** — root cause was
  `use_services_cache=True` in `establish_connection` returning stale GATT services cached
  from when the device was in Proxy mode (0x1828) before factory-reset. Changed to
  `use_services_cache=False` so provisioning always does fresh service discovery and
  correctly sees the Provisioning Service (0x1827) after reset
- **Swedish (`sv`) translation placeholder validation errors** — 7 errors logged by HA on
  every startup:
  - `config.step.confirm.description`: removed unsupported `{category}` placeholder
  - `issues.bridge_unreachable.title`: removed `{host}:{port}` (placeholders not allowed in
    issue title); moved to description which now uses both `{host}` and `{port}`
  - `issues.connection_timeout.title`: removed `{device}` (not allowed in title); added
    `{device}` to description instead
  - `issues.reconnect_storm.title`: removed `{device}` (not allowed in title); description
    now includes both `{device}` and `{count}`

---

## [0.36.2] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- `TypeError: type 'ConfigEntry' is not subscriptable` on HA < 2024.4 — guard
  `ConfigEntry[TuyaBLEMeshRuntimeData]` under `TYPE_CHECKING` so older HA
  versions can load the integration without a startup crash

---

## [0.36.1] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- SIG Mesh plug provisioning timeout: `async_ble_device_from_address(connectable=True)`
  returned `None` for devices seen only via passive BLE scan — fallback to
  `connectable=False` added so bleak-retry-connector can still attempt the connection
- Provisioning outer timeout increased 20 s → 60 s to accommodate all 5 retry
  attempts with exponential backoff before being cancelled

---

## [0.36.0] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Telink LED driver pairing completely broken — `TELINK_CHAR_NOTIFY`
  does not exist; replaced with correct constant `TELINK_CHAR_STATUS`
  (`00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d1911`). All Telink pairing threw `ImportError`
  before the handshake even started (root cause of TBM-PAIRING-DEBUG)
- Missing error/abort translation keys in all 9 translation files (`en`, `sv`, `da`,
  `de`, `fi`, `fr`, `kl`, `nb`, `nl`, `uk`): `cannot_connect_ble`, `pairing_failed`,
  `verify_failed`, `device_type_mismatch`, `unknown_device_type`, `ble_adapter_busy`,
  `invalid_bridge_host` (error), `reconfigure_successful`, `not_in_pairing_mode`,
  `entry_not_found` (abort) — users no longer see blank errors during pairing

### Changed
- Full linting, type checking, and security pipeline green (ruff, mypy --strict,
  bandit, pip-audit, detect-secrets — 8/8 checks passing)

### Tests
- 1800 tests passing (unit + security)

---

- Routine INFO logging reduced to DEBUG (less logspam)
- Light entity migrated to `CoordinatorEntity`
- `__getattr__/__setattr__` proxy removed from coordinator
- `config_flow VERSION=1` added; reconnect debounce delay added
